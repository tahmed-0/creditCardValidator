Credit Card Validator

This is a simple JavaScript program that uses Luhn's algorithm to validate a credit card number entered by the user. It is implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

How Luhn's Algorithm Works

Luhn's algorithm is a checksum formula used to validate various identification numbers, such as credit card numbers. It verifies whether a given number is potentially valid or not based on a specific set of calculations.

The algorithm follows these steps:

Starting from the rightmost digit (excluding the check digit) and moving left, double the value of every second digit.
If the doubling operation results in a two-digit number, sum the digits of the product (e.g., 16 becomes 1 + 6 = 7 or 18 becomes 1 + 8 = 9).
Sum all the obtained digits, including the unchanged digits from step 1.
If the total sum modulo 10 is equal to 0, the credit card number is valid.
Getting Started

To use this program, follow these steps:

Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
Open the index.html file in a web browser.
The webpage will be displayed, showing an input field and a "Validate" button.
Enter the credit card number you want to validate in the input field.
Click the "Validate" button to check if the credit card number is valid.
The result will be displayed below the input field, indicating whether the number is valid or not.
